# Legacy Components

This directory contains legacy/experimental components that were part of earlier development iterations but are not part of the current production system.

## glimmr-pipeline/

**Status**: Legacy/Unused  
**Date**: ~July 2024  
**Purpose**: Alternative database schema and deployment approach focused on insurance rates processing

This was an experimental approach with:
- Different database schema (insurance_rates table with partitioning)
- Alternative deployment scripts
- Focus on rate analytics and processing

**Current Status**: Replaced by the main application schema and deployment scripts in the root directory.

**Recommendation**: Archive only - not for production use.
