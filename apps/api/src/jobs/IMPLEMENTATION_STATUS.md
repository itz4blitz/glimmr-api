# Job Processing System Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- Created comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` outlining the complete data pipeline
- Documented all job types, data flow, and processing strategies
- Defined API endpoints for price lookups

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Added `queue` field to `jobs` table for better job tracking
- Added `storageKey` and `fileHash` fields to `price_transparency_files` table
- Applied migrations to support file storage tracking

### 3. PRA File Download Processor
- **File**: `processors/pra-file-download.processor.ts`
- **Queue**: `pra-file-download`
- **Features**:
  - Downloads files from hospital URLs
  - Streams large files to storage (MinIO/S3)
  - Calculates SHA256 hash for integrity
  - Tracks download progress
  - Handles errors with retry logic
  - Updates job and file records in database
  - Queues files for parsing after download

### 4. Price File Parser Processor
- **File**: `processors/price-file-parser.processor.ts`
- **Queue**: `price-file-parser`
- **Features**:
  - Supports CSV parsing with papaparse
  - Supports JSON parsing (including CMS format)
  - Supports Excel (XLSX/XLS) parsing
  - Placeholder for ZIP extraction
  - Intelligent field mapping
  - Batch processing for large files
  - Automatic code type detection (CPT, DRG, HCPCS, ICD-10)
  - Extracts payer-specific rates
  - Queues batches for normalization

## 🚧 In Progress

### 1. Price Normalization Processor
- **Queue**: `price-update`
- **Purpose**: Normalize and validate price data
- **Required**:
  - Standardize code formats
  - Validate price ranges
  - Calculate min/max rates across payers
  - Flag data quality issues
  - Update normalized fields

### 2. Analytics Refresh Processor
- **Queue**: `analytics-refresh`
- **Purpose**: Generate analytics and aggregations
- **Required**:
  - Calculate hospital-level statistics
  - Generate regional averages
  - Build service category summaries
  - Update trending data

## ❌ Not Implemented

### 1. Hospital Import Processor
- **Queue**: `hospital-import`
- **Note**: May not be needed if PRA Unified Scan handles all hospital imports

### 2. Data Validation Processor
- **Queue**: `data-validation`
- **Purpose**: Validate data integrity and quality
- **Required**:
  - Cross-reference codes with standard databases
  - Validate hospital information
  - Check for duplicate prices
  - Generate quality reports

### 3. ZIP File Extraction
- Currently placeholder in price file parser
- Need to implement extraction and queue individual files

### 4. API Endpoints for Price Lookups
- `/api/v1/hospitals/:hospitalId/prices`
- `/api/v1/prices/search?zipcode=X&serviceCode=Y`
- `/api/v1/prices/compare`

### 5. Enhanced Job Monitoring
- Better error tracking with full stack traces
- Job performance metrics
- Queue health monitoring
- Alert system for failures

## 📊 Current Data Pipeline Status

```
PRA API → ✅ PRA Unified Scan → ✅ PRA File Download → ✅ Price File Parser → ❌ Price Normalization → ❌ Analytics
                                           ↓
                                    ✅ Storage (MinIO/S3)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Migration System**: The Drizzle migration system has conflicts. Manual migrations may be needed.

2. **Job Tracking**: The generic `jobs` table doesn't fully integrate with BullMQ job IDs.

3. **Memory Usage**: Large CSV files are parsed in memory. Consider streaming for files >100MB.

4. **Error Recovery**: Need better error recovery for partial file downloads.

## 🎯 Priority Next Steps

1. **Implement Price Normalization Processor**
   - Critical for making price data queryable
   - Standardize all codes and calculate aggregates

2. **Create Price Lookup APIs**
   - Hospital-specific price endpoints
   - Zipcode-based search with radius
   - Price comparison across hospitals

3. **Implement Analytics Processor**
   - Generate summary statistics
   - Build search indices
   - Calculate trending data

4. **Add Comprehensive Error Tracking**
   - Capture full stack traces
   - Add retry policies per error type
   - Implement alert system

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement streaming for large files
   - Add database indices for common queries
   - Optimize batch processing sizes

## 📈 Metrics to Track

- Jobs processed per hour by queue
- Success/failure rates by job type
- Average processing time per file size
- Number of price records extracted
- Data quality scores
- Storage usage trends

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

1. **Queue Concurrency**: Adjust based on server resources
2. **Retry Policies**: Fine-tune for each job type
3. **Storage Limits**: Set max file sizes
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect hospital server limits
5. **Alert Thresholds**: Define failure tolerance

## 🚀 Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Each processor should have comprehensive tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full pipeline with sample files
3. **Load Tests**: Verify system handles large files
4. **Error Tests**: Ensure graceful failure handling
5. **E2E Tests**: Test from PRA scan to API query
