### ‚úÖ 4. Advanced Query Capabilities
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Features Enhanced:**
- Complex filter expressions with `and`/`or` operators
- Multiple comparison operators: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `ge`, `le`
- String functions: `contains()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`
- Case-insensitive search with `$search` parameter
- Enhanced `$select` with computed field support

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Complex filters work: `state eq 'CA' and bedCount gt 100`
- ‚úÖ String functions work: `contains(name,'General')`
- ‚úÖ Search across multiple fields: `$search=cardiology`
- ‚úÖ Select specific fields: `$select=name,state,hasLocation`
- ‚úÖ All filter mappings properly configured for each entity

## Analytics Testing Results

### ‚úÖ 5. Analytics Refresh Processor
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Features Implemented:**
- Comprehensive analytics processor with 5 metric types
- Summary metrics (total counts, averages)
- Price variance analysis (coefficient of variation)
- Geographic metrics (state-level aggregations)
- Service-level metrics (top expensive services)
- Trend analysis (6-month price changes)

**Metric Types Calculated:**
1. **Summary Metrics**: Total hospitals, total prices, average prices
2. **Variance Metrics**: Price coefficient of variation by service
3. **Geographic Metrics**: Average prices by state
4. **Service Metrics**: Top 25 most expensive services
5. **Trend Metrics**: 6-month price change percentages

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ All 5 metric types calculate correctly with proper SQL aggregations
- ‚úÖ Confidence scores calculated based on sample sizes
- ‚úÖ Metadata includes additional context (price ranges, sample sizes)
- ‚úÖ Batch insertion optimized for large metric sets
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging throughout calculation process

### ‚úÖ 6. Analytics Refresh Job Triggering
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Features Implemented:**
- Manual trigger endpoint: `POST /api/v1/jobs/analytics/refresh`
- Configurable metric types, force refresh, and reporting periods
- Job queue integration with BullMQ
- Progress tracking and status reporting

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Endpoint properly accepts configuration parameters
- ‚úÖ Job is queued with correct data and options
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking works during metric calculations
- ‚úÖ Results are stored in analytics table with proper timestamps

### ‚úÖ 7. Price Variance Analysis Validation
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Statistical Calculations Verified:**
- Coefficient of Variation: œÉ/Œº (standard deviation / mean)
- Sample size requirements (minimum 5 data points)
- Confidence scoring based on logarithmic sample size scaling
- Price range calculations (max - min)

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Coefficient of variation formula correctly implemented
- ‚úÖ Only services with sufficient data (‚â•5 samples) included
- ‚úÖ Results ordered by highest variance (most price inconsistency)
- ‚úÖ Confidence scores properly scaled: log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(sampleSize) / 2

## Queue Monitoring and Health Testing

### ‚úÖ 8. Queue Monitoring Endpoints
**Status: VERIFIED**

**Available Endpoints:**
- Bull Board Dashboard: `/api/v1/admin/queues`
- Job Statistics: `GET /api/v1/jobs/stats`
- Job Queue Status: `GET /api/v1/jobs`
- Cleanup Statistics: `GET /api/v1/jobs/cleanup/stats`

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Bull Board provides real-time queue monitoring
- ‚úÖ Job statistics include counts by status across all queues
- ‚úÖ Queue health metrics available through cleanup stats
- ‚úÖ Performance data accessible for all registered queues

### üîÑ 9. Health Endpoint Queue Status
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic health endpoint exists at `/api/v1/health`
- Returns service health status with HTTP codes

**Recommended Enhancement:**
- Add queue connection status to health checks
- Include queue latency metrics
- Monitor for stalled jobs or queue failures

### ‚ùì 10. Real-time Metrics Endpoints
**Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Assessment:**
The current analytics system is batch-oriented rather than real-time. The existing analytics endpoints provide:
- Dashboard analytics (aggregated data)
- Trend analysis (historical patterns)
- Export functionality (data downloads)

**Recommendation:**
Real-time metrics would require WebSocket or Server-Sent Events implementation for live updates.

### ‚ùì 11. Benchmarking Endpoints
**Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Assessment:**
No dedicated benchmarking endpoints exist. The current system provides:
- Service-level average pricing
- Geographic comparisons by state
- Computed fields for price spreads and percentiles

**Recommendation:**
Benchmarking could be added as computed metrics in the analytics refresh processor.
