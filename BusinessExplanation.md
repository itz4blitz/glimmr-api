# Glimmr Health - Healthcare Price Transparency Platform

## 🎯 **What We're Building**

Glimmr Health is a **healthcare price transparency platform** that compares what hospitals charge vs. what insurance companies actually pay for medical procedures. Built on enterprise-grade infrastructure that automatically scales, secures, and manages itself.

## 🏗️ **The Big Picture**
