# Swagger Documentation Investigation

## Issue Summary
GitHub Issue #3 reported that "Swagger documentation is not accessible at the expected `/docs` endpoint, returning 404 errors."

## Investigation Results

### Findings
1. **Swagger Configuration is Correct**: The setup in `apps/api/src/main.ts` (lines 45-63) is properly configured
2. **API Prefix Configuration**: The API is configured with `API_PREFIX=api` in the environment
3. **Correct Endpoint**: Swagger docs are served at `/api/docs`, not `/docs`

### Technical Details
- **Swagger Setup**: `SwaggerModule.setup(apiPrefix ? \`${apiPrefix}/docs\` : 'docs', app, document)`
- **API Prefix**: `api` (from environment variable)
- **Expected URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`
- **Logged URL**: Bootstrap message shows `docsUrl: "http://localhost:3000/api/docs"`

### Root Cause
The issue was a **documentation/expectation mismatch** rather than a code issue. The user expected `/docs` but the API correctly serves documentation at `/api/docs` due to the API prefix configuration.

### Resolution
- ✅ Swagger documentation is accessible at `/api/docs`
- ✅ Configuration is correct and follows NestJS best practices
- ✅ API prefix properly applied to all routes including documentation
- ✅ No code changes required

### Development Environment Setup
Created proper development environment configuration:
- Database: PostgreSQL at localhost:5432
- Redis: localhost:6379 (for job queues)
- Storage: MinIO at localhost:9000
- API: localhost:3000 with prefix `/api`

## Conclusion
The Swagger documentation is working correctly at `/api/docs`. The issue was resolved by clarifying the correct endpoint location based on the API prefix configuration.
